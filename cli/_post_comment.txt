Post comment on memo.

The comment content is read from STDIN. If the content starts from FRONT MATTER, it is parsed as YAML
and used as memo attributes (overwritten by options).

Usage: docbase post [OPTIONS]

Options:
  --[no-]notice                   Send notification
  --author-id <AUTHOR>            User ID or URL (Admin only)
  --published-at <PUBLISHED_AT>   Published date (ISO 8601, Admin only)
  -h, --help                      Show help

Front matter example:

  notice: false
