Post a comment on a memo.

The comment content is read from STDIN unless --file option is specified.
If the content starts from FRONT MATTER, it is parsed as YAML and used as memo
attributes (overwritten by options).

Arguments:
  DOMAIN                          Domain name of the team
  MEMO                            Memo ID or URL to post comment

Options:
  -f, --file <FILE>               File path to post
  --[no-]notice                   Send notification
  --author-id <AUTHOR>            User ID or URL (Admin only)
  --published-at <PUBLISHED_AT>   Published date (ISO 8601, Admin only)
  -h, --help                      Show help

  ---
  notice: false
  ---
